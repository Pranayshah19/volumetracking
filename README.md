# Hand Tracking Volume Controller 🎛️✋

This project implements a volume control system using hand tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe. The program captures real-time video from your webcam, detects the position of your thumb and index finger, and adjusts the system volume based on the distance between them.

## Features
- **Hand Tracking:** Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks.
- **Volume Control:** Adjusts system volume based on finger distance.
- **Real-time FPS:** Displays frames per second (FPS) on the screen for performance monitoring.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- osascript (for macOS to control system volume)

You can install the required Python libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```
## Installation and Usage 🚀

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranayshah19/volumetracking.git
   cd volumetracking
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   python VolumeControl.py
   ```

3. **Adjust Volume:**
   - Move your thumb and index finger closer or further apart to increase or decrease the volume.
   - The system volume will automatically adjust based on the finger distance.

## Hand Tracking Module 🖐️

The hand tracking is done using a custom module `HandTrackingModule.py`, which leverages MediaPipe's hand landmarks. Here's a breakdown of the main features:

- **findHands:** Detects hands and draws landmarks.
- **findPosition:** Extracts the position of hand landmarks.

You can reuse this module in other projects for hand tracking.

## Volume Control Algorithm 🎚️

- The distance between the thumb (landmark 4) and index finger (landmark 8) is calculated.
- This distance is interpolated to a volume range (0-100%).
- The system volume is adjusted accordingly using osascript (for macOS).

## How It Works 🔍

1. The webcam captures a video feed.
2. MediaPipe detects the hand and returns landmark positions.
3. The Euclidean distance between the thumb and index finger is computed.
4. The distance is mapped to the system volume range, and the volume is updated in real-time.

## Example Output
```
Volume Level: 65% | Thumb: (x1, y1) | Index: (x2, y2)
```

## Known Issues & Limitations ⚠️
- The volume control script currently works only on **macOS** (due to osascript for system volume control). Adaptation for other operating systems (like Windows or Linux) is needed.
- Hand detection accuracy can vary based on lighting conditions and camera quality.

## Future Improvements 🌱
- Add support for Windows and Linux volume control.
- Fine-tune hand tracking accuracy.
- Optimize performance for higher FPS.
